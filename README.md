# Data analysis - Summer Internship at Tyme Wear, Boston (USA)
Data analysis of user data in Google Firebase. Downloading, analyzing, statistics and automatically writing the results to Google Sheet. Started developing a solution with Python and a tool connecting to Google Sheets API. The company needed the data to be auto-synced in realtime, so then I developed a solution in Google Apps Script with a trigger that automatically runs the script frequently.
